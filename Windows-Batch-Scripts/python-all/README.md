# python-all

python-all is a command to run all python scripts in the current working directory.

## Usage
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you have kept your python scripts to run. And then type

```python-all```

and hit enter.

Just add this batch file to your system path variables. Then type in the above command in the terminal of your choice (I use CMD).
