# javr

```javr``` is a combination of ```javac``` and ``java`` commands which are usually used to compile and run a Java source code from the terminal.

## Usage
```javr "path\to\JavaSourceFile"```

If you have a Java Source named ```MyClass.java``` in your current working directory, then open a terminal of your choice and navigate to the current working directory and then use ```javr``` like this: ```javr MyClass```

**NOTE: Do not append .java to the Source File name while using this command.**
