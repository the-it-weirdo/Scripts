# git-it

git-it is a simple combination of my most used git commnds viz.

git add _something_ <br>
git commit -m "some message" <br>
git push

I combined these 3 commands into one which is this ```git-it```.

## Usage
```git-it "path\to\file" "Some Commit Message"```

Just add this batch file to your system path variables and open the local git repo which you wish to use. Then type in the above command in the terminal of your choice (I use CMD).

_Remember to replace "path\to\file" and "Some commit message" accordingly and hit enter._
